1. Open your cmd prompt and navigate to the directory of the code.
2. Run the build.bat script. This should put the compiled code in the bin folder.
3. Profit.

#### How to build on linux
1. Open your terminal and navigate to the directory of the code.
2. Run the build.sh script. This will put the binaries in the bin folder.
3. Profit.

### How to run DnD
